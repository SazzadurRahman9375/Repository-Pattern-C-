Overview:
The project aims to develop a comprehensive Trainee Information System using .NET Framework and C#. It will incorporate advanced architectural patterns like Dependency Injection and Repository Pattern to facilitate a scalable, modular, and maintainable system for managing trainee details within an educational or organizational setting.
Features:
Trainee Management: Implement functionalities to handle trainee information, including personal details, course enrollment, progress tracking, and performance evaluation.
Dependency Injection: Utilize the built-in dependency injection framework of .NET to achieve loosely coupled and easily testable components.
Repository Pattern: Implement repositories to abstract data access, providing a clear separation between data manipulation and business logic.


Technologies Used:
.NET Framework: Providing a powerful and versatile framework for building scalable applications.
C# Programming Language: Utilized for backend development, business logic, and data manipulation.
Dependency Injection (DI): Leveraging .NET's native DI capabilities for managing dependencies.
Repository Pattern Implementation: Building repositories for abstracting data access and manipulation.
